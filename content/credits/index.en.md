The main body of the manual was written during a **Book Sprint** led by Derek
Holzer in the [moddr_lab](http://moddr.net "moddr_lab @ WORM, Rotterdam") at
WORM in Rotterdam, the Netherlands, between 23 and 27 November 2009, with input 
and support from the international community of Ardour users and developers. 
The tutorial was originally written for Ardour 2.X versions. The original FLOSS
manual can be found at
[flossmanuals.net](http://archive.flossmanuals.net/ardour/index.html).
