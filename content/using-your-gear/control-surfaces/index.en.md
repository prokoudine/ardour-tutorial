Ardour supports a variety of controls surfaces that provide convenient hardware interface for accessing program's features.

Here are some of them:

- PreSonus FaderPort 2/8/16
- Steinberg CC121
- Contour Design Shuttle
- Novation Control LX

For documentation specific to those surfaces, please read the relevant chapters of the [user manual](https://manual.ardour.org/using-control-surfaces/).

Control surfaces that have dedicated integration do not need enabling manually. Just plug them in and start using immediately.
