You may wish to export only a region of your session, perhaps to use as a
sample in another application, or to edit it in a different program. This
chapter shows you how to do that.

## Exporting a Region

To export a region, select it in _Grab_ mode and then right-click into the
sub-menu _Export_, or use the top menu: `Region > Export`.

![export region](en/ardour7-export-region-in-right-click-menu.png?width=600)

This will open up the same export dialog box explained in the
[Exporting Sessions](../exporting-a-session) chapter. Choose your options and
click **Export**. Only the selected region will be exported.

{{< callout type="info" >}}
Not all parameters and edits are taken into consideraton when exporting a
region. Trimmed, split, stretched and reversed regions can be exported, but
edits such as panning and automation are _not_ exported.

Also, the volume of the audio track itself or the _Master_ bus will not affect
the exported file. To export these edits, please see the chapters on exporting
a range and exporting a session.

## Exporting Several Regions At Once

If you are building a collection of samples to use later in another software,
and your samples are basically trimmed and edited regions, at the end of the
process you will need to export all of them. If the number is large, exporting
them manually can be tedious. Here's one way of exporting several regions at
once.

1. In _Grab_ mode (**G** shortcut), select all the regions you want to export.
They do not need to be on the same track.

2. Go to the `Region > Ranges` menu and choose _Add Range Marker Per Region_.

{{< figure alt="export region" src="en/ardour7-export-multiple-regions-2.png" >}}

3. Ardour has now just created range markers that fit exactly the beginning and
ending of your selected regions (see the green rectangles in the range markers
ruler):

{{< figure alt="export region" src="en/ardour7-export-multiple-regions-3.png" >}}

4. Go to the `Session > Export` menu and choose _Export to Audio File(s)_
(**Alt+E**).

5. In the export dialog box, click on the _Time span_ tab. You will see all the
newly created ranges listed there. There is also a default range that stands for
the entire session. 

6. Under _Time Span_, click **Select All** and de-select the very first range
(the "session" range). The reason is because we want to export the shorter
ranges, not the whole session.

7. Go back to the main tab (_File format_) and click **Export**.

Your regions have now been exported to single audio files.

{{< callout type="info" >}}
This method exports *everything* that falls under each defined time range.
In other words, if you have other regions in other tracks sounding
simultaneously with the region(s) you want to export, they will be mixed 
together. Another way of looking at it is this: the export operation will
export everything that *plays* under the defined time ranges. If that is not
what you want, you can use solo or mute buttons on select tracks to ensure 
you export only what you want.

## Continuing

Finally, the next chapter will discuss _Exporting Ranges_ rather than just an
individual region. The last trick (exporting multiple regions at once) in fact
already involved using ranges, as you may have guessed.
