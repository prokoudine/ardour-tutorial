Before launching a clip or a cue, let’s learn to load clips into trigger slots.

There are several ways to do that.

You can select the trigger slot, then click the Load button in the clip properties box and point Ardour to an audio or a MIDI file.

You can drag an arbitrary audio or MIDI file from a file manager to a trigger slot.

Or you can bounce a region or a range directly from the editor to a particular cue.
