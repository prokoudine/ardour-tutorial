Before launching a clip or a cue, let’s learn to load clips into trigger slots.

<!-- {{< youtube ASN6OMYxe9I >}} -->

There are several ways to do that.

## Load in the Clip Properties box

You can select the trigger slot, then click the Load button in the clip properties box and point Ardour to an audio or a MIDI file.

## Drag & drop from file manager

You can drag an arbitrary audio or MIDI file from a file manager to a trigger slot.

## Drag & drop from the Clips sidebar

Or you can bounce a region or a range directly from the editor to a particular cue.
