Both timeline and cue sequencing have their pros and cons. With timelines you do not have to restrict yourself with musical time or think in terms of clip launch quantization. With cues, however, you can easily program a beat sequence using just a few clips. And thanks to cue markers you can have the best of both worlds.

Here is how it works.

Create tracks where regions will be played from the timeline. This could be a MIDI track where you improvise playing a virtual piano or an audio track with your acoustic guitar.

Then create tracks that will be used for cue sequencing, drop your loops into the triggers slots and program a few cues. Let’s say it’s four variations of drums and bass, each in its own cue.

<!-- FIXME SCREENSHOT -->

Now go back to the Editor window, right click on the ruler where you want the first cue to start, then select “Cue A”. Both clips in Cue A last 4 bars and repeat twice, so count 8 bars and add a marker for Cue B.

Now, maybe you want a bit of a solo going on next, so right click on the ruler and choose “Stop All Cues”.

<!-- FIXME SCREENSHOT -->

This will stop all cue sequencing, but the transport will keep rolling. Now do your solo, and then insert markers for Cue C and Cue D the very same way.

<!-- FIXME SCREENSHOT -->

When you are finally done with cues, add another marker to stop all cues.

How complex your real cue programming will be is up to you.
