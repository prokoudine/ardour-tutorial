You can reuse existing audio and MIDI files by adding them as regions on existing or new tracks. To do so, press the **Ctrl+I** shortcut or go to the `Session > Import` menu to open the _Add Existing Media_ dialog, pick a file of interest, and import it.

Some settings are the same for audio and MIDI, some are format-specific.

## Playing existing files

Before you import a file, it's a good idea to make sure it's the right one. On the right side of the _Add Existing Media_ dialog you will see a section allowing you to inspect the properties of the file you selected. Here you will see the name, number of channels, sample rate, format and length of the sound file, along with any tags you have chosen to add to the file.

The **Play** button allows you to preview the file. You can also select **Auto-play** if you would like to hear a sound file immediately as soon as you click on it in the file browser (without having to push the **Play** button).

For MIDI files, you can select a virtual instrument that will be used to play
the selected MIDI file, although you won't be able to select a particular
synth patch.

## Choosing Tracks and Insertion Point

There are some common scenarios for importing media files: importing multiple
audio files as new tracks and inserting them into the session start, importing
multiple audio files to the list of of available sources for later use,
importing one MIDI file into an existing track at the playhead position, etc.
So there are two important options here: where to insert a region generally
(which track, if at all), and which point of the timeline to insert to.

The _Add files …_ drop-down list if where you choose the former, and the
_Insert at_ drop-down list is where you choose the latter.

## Inserting to Sources list

Let's start with the scenario where you import some audio files into the list of sources.

> [!TIP]
> If you do not have any suitable audio files on your hard drive to follow these
steps, visit [freesound.org](http://www.freesound.org/)), where you can find a
large collection of Public Domain and Creative Commons–licensed samples in a
variety of sample rates and formats.

Select some files and in the _Add files…_ drop-down list choose _to source list_. Make sure the _Mapping_ options says _one region per file_.

![Add to source list](en/ardour7-to-source-list.png)

You will notice that the option _Copy files to session_ is checked by default. This will make a copy of the imported file(s) into the folder of the current session. This is safer, but it uses more disk space. If you uncheck this option (not recommended!), Ardour will use the sound file from its current location on the hard drive. In this case, if the file is moved to a new location on the hard drive, you will run into trouble, because Ardour won't be able to find it the next time you open this session. **It is highly recommended that you leave this box checked (_Copy files to session_)**. 

Click **OK** to proceed.

The file(s) you have imported will appear listed in your _Sources_ list. This list is located at the far right of the editor window. If you don't see it, make sure _Show Editor List_ is checked under the _View_ menu.

![Editor List](en/ardour7-audio-imported-to-sources-list.png?height=50vh)

By dragging and dropping an audio file listed on the _Sources_ list onto the main canvas, you can insert it in an existing or new track. If you drag it into an existing track, it will be added there. If you drag onto the empty space beneath existing tracks, a new track will be automatically created to accommodate it.

Release the mouse button to complete the drag-and-drop operation. A new region will be inserted at the exact time point where you dropped it.

> [!TIP]
> If a sound file is selected in the Editor List (i.e., if it is highlighted in blue), the next time you click on that file name, Ardour will think you are trying to rename the region (the name will become editable). More likely you were just trying to click to drag and drop the file onto a track. In order to click and drag a previously _highlighted_ region from the list, you need to point and click in the empty space right before or after the name.

Important: always make sure you are placing stereo regions on stereo tracks. If you drag a stereo file onto a mono audio track, only the left channel will be used. In the screenshot below, a stereo file with very distinct left and right channels was dragged onto a stereo track and a mono track. Notice that in the mono track only the left channel is displayed (and played back).

## Importing Directly to a Track

As mentioned earlier, the _Add existing media_ dialog also allows you to import audio files directly onto tracks.

Choose _Add files… as new tracks_ to automatically create a new track and add the selected file to it. The track will be named after the sound file name.

![Add as New Tracks](en/ardour7-import-as-new-tracks.png)

If you have previously selected one or more tracks, the menu will display the additional option _Add files… to selected tracks_ to add a sound file into the already existing selected track.

Note that if you import a multitrack MIDI file, Ardour will always create one new track per one existing track in the MIDI file and map them accordingly.

When adding files as new tracks, note that the _Mapping_ options lets you choose between _one track per channel_ and _one track per file_. For the purpose of this tutorial, choose _one track per file_, otherwise the left and right channels of a stereo file will be split into two separate tracks.

Alternatively, you can drag and drop audio and MIDI files from a file manager to the timeline to import them.

## Choose Insert Point

When using either one of the options above (_Add as new track_ or _Add to selected tracks_), you should also specify where in the track you want the new region to be placed. In the screenshot below, we are choosing _session start_.

![Insert At](en/ardour7-insert-point-list.png)

The region appears in a new track in the session. The new track automatically receives the name of the imported sound file.

The sound file will also appear in the _Regions_ list so that it can be inserted into other tracks as well by dragging and dropping it.

## Remove Regions from Tracks

To remove a region from a track, you can select it with the mouse and use the *Cut* function from the menu, the **Control** (or **Apple**) key and the **X** key, the **Delete** key or the key combination of **Fn + Backspace** (which is used, for example, on a laptop keyboard that does not have a proper **Delete** key).

> [!WARNING]
> **Save your work often!** The shortcut **Control + S** is your friend. Use it a lot, all the time.

## Continuing

Now that you have some material in your session, you might want [customizing the
timeline](/getting-started/setting-up-the-timeline/) to better suit your needs or jump to [recording](/recording/) new material live.
