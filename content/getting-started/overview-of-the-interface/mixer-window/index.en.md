The main function of the _Mixer_ window is to display all the mixer strips for
the various tracks and busses side by side for easy reference and finetuning.
This window is mainly used during the _mixing_ process where you distribute
instruments across the virtual room and process them with effects to stand out
in a mix. It also provides access to plugins and routing features. Please see
the chapters on [understanding
routing](en/recording-audio/understanding-routing/),
[mixing](en/mixing-sessions/mixing-levels/), and [using
plugins](en/mixing-sessions/using-plugins/) for details.

The user interface of a virtual mixing console largely resembles that of a
physical mixing console where you have mixer channels with gain control and a
signal meter.

The _Mixer_ window has 3 larger sections:

1. Left sidebar with a list of favorite plugins, visibility control for mixer
strips, and a track/bus groups manager
2. Mixer strips for tracks and busses, including a master bus that the final
signal usually travels through
3. Optional _Monitor Section_ with features like _Pre/After Fade Listen_,
_Exclusive Solo_ etc.

## Continuing

In the next section we'll take a quick look at the _Recorder_ window that is
streamlined for launching and controlling the recording of multiple tracks at
the same time.
