The main function of the _Mixer_ window is to display all the mixer strips for the various tracks and busses side by side for easy reference and finetuning. This window is mainly used during the _mixing_ process where you distribute instruments across the virtual room and process them with effects to stand out in a mix. It also provides access to plugins and routing features. Please see the chapters on [understanding routing](en/recording-audio/understanding-routing/), [mixing](en/mixing-sessions/mixing-levels/), and [using plugins](en/mixing-sessions/using-plugins/) for details.

The user interface of a virtual mixing console largely resembles that of a physical mixing console where you have mixer channels with gain control and a signal meter.

The _Mixer_ window has 3 larger sections:

1. Left sidebar with a list of favorite plugins, visibility control for mixer strips, and a track/bus groups manager
2. Mixer strips for tracks and busses, including a master bus that the final signal usually travels through
3. Optional _Monitor Section_ with features like _Pre/After Fade Listen_, _Exclusive Solo_ etc.

**Continuing**

In the next section we'll take a quick look at the _Recorder_ window that is streamlined for launching and controlling the recording of multiple tracks at the same time.
