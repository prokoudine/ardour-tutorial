Let's learn how to install Ardour on your operating system.

## Windows

Download the installer and run it as usual. On Windows 11, you may see a warning from Microsoft Defender that the installer is an uncommon file. [This guide](https://ardour.org/windows_defender.html) explains how to deal with that.

## macOS

Download the `.dmg` file and double-click it. When the window opens, drag the Ardour icon and drop it on the Applications icon to install.

## Linux

1. Download the `.run` file
2. Navigate to the folder where it's stored:

```bash
$ cd /folder/where/you/saved/the/file
```

3. Run the installer in the terminal:

```bash
/bin/sh ./<DOWNLOADED_FILENAME>.run
```

4. Follow the instructions.

**Continuing**

Let's start Ardour now.
